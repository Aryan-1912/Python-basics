Of all the sex positions in your romp repertoire, doggy style might not be your 
go-to. Maybe you prefer the eye contact you get from missionary; or maybe, you 

just find that your arms and knees get tired. But hear me out: What if I told you that some very simple tweaks and tips can turn doggy into your favorite position?

Put simply, doggy style sex involves one partner getting 


on all fours, while the other partner is on their knees, 

entering the first person from behind with their penis or strap-on,


 says Nan Wise, PhD, a licensed psychotherapist and certified sex therapist, 
 
 and author of Why Good Sex Matters. For some kinky folks, this position can 
 provide an element of power play, with the giving partner "dominating" the receiver.
  For others, it might simply feel good. After all, "you can get the deepest penetration possible in this position, and you can also reach the G-spot," says Ava Cadell, PhD, clinical sexologist, AASECT-certified sex counselor, and author of Neuroloveology.
